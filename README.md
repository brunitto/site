# My Static Site Project

## Description

This project is a simple static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, served by `http-server`. It's a basic template demonstrating a minimal frontend setup.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started / Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory-name>
    ```
    (Replace `<project-directory-name>` with the name of the cloned directory)

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `http-server` as a development dependency. Install it and any other dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

To view the website, you need to start the development server:

1.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command will use `http-server` to serve the files in the `public` directory.

2.  **Accessing the site:**
    Once the server is running, it will typically output the URLs where you can access the site. By default, `http-server` often uses port 8080. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

    You should see the "Welcome to My Static Site" page. To stop the server, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.
